Realtek ALC245 Linux Fix (Unsolicited / Button Events)

The stop/play button of my own kz edx pro x headset was not working on linux, so I did something that worked using microphone explosions, don't press the button completely, just tap it lightly, don't hesitate to write if there is an error. 

İnstallation 

Download install.sh 

and (in the same folder) 
 
 chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

Note: Yes, it works even if you shout towards the button:D
