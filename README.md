Realtek ALC245 Linux Fix (Unsolicited / Button Events)

The stop/play button of my own kz edx pro x headset was not working on linux, so I did something that worked using microphone explosions, don't press the button completely, just tap it lightly, don't hesitate to write if there is an error. 

Note: Yes, it works even if you shout towards the button:D
